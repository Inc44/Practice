# a
`kill -SIGTERM pid`: child process terminates, `waitpid()` returns `pid`.
`kill -SIGTSTP pid`: child process stops, `waitpid()` returns `pid`.
`kill -SIGCONT pid`: child process continues, `waitpid()` returns `pid`; if child process was not stopped, `waitpid()` returns nothing as state is not changed.
`kill -SIGKILL pid`: child process is killed immediately, `waitpid()` returns `pid`.
`kill -SIGINT pid` is ignored due to `SIG_IGN`.
# b
`waitpid()` returns -1 when parent loses child process; therefore, until all child processes are killed, loop continues.
# c
Ctrl+C sends `SIGINT` to the entire group of terminal processes; child ignores it due to `SIG_IGN`; parent process receives it and terminates; all child processes become orphaned and are adopted by the `init` process, continuing infinite loop in the background.
